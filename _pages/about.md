Thank you for visiting my website!

I am a senior undergraduate at Fudan University, majoring in mathematics and applied mathematics. During the summer of 2023, I was very fortunate to work with [Prof. Akihiko Nishimura](https://aki-nishimura.github.io/) on observational health data analytics. My project focused on addressing computational challenges in transferring knowledge across a network of health databases. Previously, I have worked with [Prof. Xinwei Sun](https://sunxinwei0625.github.io/sunxw.github.io/) at Fudan University.

My interests lie at the intersection of statistics and healthcare. I am committed to developing novel statistical methods and tools driven by real-world applications in biomedical research. I hope to contribute to a world with improved understanding of diseases, more personalized treatments and better health outcomes using statistical knowledge.

In my spare time, I enjoy dancing, doing yoga and playing badminton.
